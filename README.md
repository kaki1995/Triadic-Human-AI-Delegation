# Triadic Human–AI Delegation

This repository provides the simulation framework and synthetic data generator supporting the Master’s thesis titled "Revisiting Delegation Theory in the Age of AI: Dynamic Algorithm Appreciation and Aversion in Triadic Organizational Relationships."

The project investigates how managers dynamically delegate task execution and decision authority to AI systems within triadic organizational settings involving managers, AI systems, and human employees. It focuses on how algorithm appreciation and aversion evolve as managers receive performance feedback under uncertainty and performance pressure.

**Conceptual Motivation**

As Artificial Intelligence becomes embedded in core managerial tasks—such as forecasting, resource allocation, pricing, and inventory reallocation—managerial work increasingly shifts from direct decision execution to orchestrating and calibrating authority across hybrid human–AI systems.

This transformation challenges traditional dyadic delegation theory, which assumes stable, unidirectional delegation from managers to human subordinates. Instead, AI-enabled organizations operate through triadic delegation structures, where:

- Managers retain formal accountability and KPI responsibility, 
  
- AI systems generate recommendations, execute tasks, or escalate uncertainty, and
  
- Human employees execute, coordinate, or override AI-supported decisions.

Within these triads, delegation becomes fluid, reciprocal, and dynamic, rather than a one-time allocation of authority.
